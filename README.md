# addressbook_cli
AddressBook 1.0 is a simple, (relatively) easy to use command-line contact manager that helps to keep track of your contacts, including email addresses, phones, addresses and birthdays. It enables users to create their own address books, save them (in pickle format) and restore data from existing ones. Options include adding, modifying and removing entries, as well as sorting and searching through them.

This project is my first humble foray into programming - it was created solely for the sake of learning Python and wasn't intended for real-life application. I'm perfectly aware of its numerous flaws and open to advice and suggestions.

Things to do:
  - create a GUI - SQLite version
  - break unit tests into separate parts
  - enable parsing phone numbers other than Polish ones
